Welcome to the MK Partners Weekly Puzzle!

A regular challenge for bragging rights, the coveted "extra tall" trophy, and a spin of the incredibly-engineered and criminally underutilized prize-wheel.

Every Monday (starting again now, because I've been bad at keeping this up - mostly because good puzzles are hard to find), we'll post a puzzle in the appropriately dated "Puzzles" folder. All you have to do is solve it!

Once you've got your answer, submit it in the "Solutions and Educated Guesses" folder under your name. The next week we'll announce the winner, the new challenge, and the process begins anew!

If you're new to GitHub, we'll try to put some guides in the "Github Tutorial" folder so you can get up and running quickly but, if you need some more hands-on help, don't be afraid to ask.

Lastly, if you have any recommendations for future challenges, feel free to add them to the "Suggested Puzzles" folder and I'll use them. It'll also make me happy because I'll actually be able to take a guess at those myself. (Also, no peeking in there if you're not submitting a puzzle because then you could get a head start or even see the soltuions for future puzzles and that would be sad, and thus, make me sad.)

Good luck and happy thinking!
