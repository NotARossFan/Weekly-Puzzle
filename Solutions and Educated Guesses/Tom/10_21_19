The Counterfeit Coin Challenge
You are given 8 coins and told that one of them is counterfeit. The counterfeit one is slightly heavier 
than the other seven. Otherwise, the coins look identical. Using a simple balance scale, how can you determine 
which coin is counterfeit using the scale only twice?

Place 3 coins on each side of the scale and hold 2 on the side.

If the weight of the 6 coins on the scale (3x3) is even then discard the coins since they are all real and weigh
the last two coins on the scale to find the counterfeit. 

if the weight of the 6 coins is not even, than take the three coins on the heavier side and place one coin on each 
side of the scale for the second weigh in while holding the third remaining coin. If the two coins on the scale are 
even then you are holding the conterfeit coin. If the conterfeit is on the scale then it will be the heavier coin.
